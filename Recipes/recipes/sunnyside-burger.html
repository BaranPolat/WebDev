    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The combination of the egg and the aioli makes this burger special. 
        Grab a few napkins, it can get deliciously messy! 
        When assembling the burger I recommend you spread the aioli on the bottom bun so the top bun is available for the egg.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk mayonnaise, 1 large garlic clove, chipotle powder, and pinch of salt together in a small bowl; cover and refrigerate. </li>
        <li>Place ground beef, 1 egg, seasoned bread crumbs, 2 garlic cloves, coriander, black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl;
             mix with your hands until just combined. Shape beef mixture into 4 patties. </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Cook patties on preheated grill until browned on one side, about 6 minutes.
            Flip patties; continue grilling until no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). 
            Transfer burgers to a plate; top each burger with a slice of Cheddar cheese and cover plate tightly with foil. </li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. 
            Crack remaining eggs into skillet and immediately reduce the heat to low; season eggs with salt and pepper.
             Cook eggs until whites are set, about 2 minutes; add 1 tablespoon water to skillet, cover, and cook 1 to 2 minutes more. </li>
        <li>Spread about 1 tablespoon chipotle aioli on bottom of each hamburger bun; 
            top each bun with 1 lettuce leaf, 1 onion slice, 1 tomato slice, and 1 burger. 
            Add one egg to top of each burger; place top of hamburger bun over egg. </li>
    </ol>
